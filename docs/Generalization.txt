Intensity plot:  Generalization of Microsatelites (musat) - (intensity)  Intensity of a trait in samples 

Sample consists of entity, trait, intensity

* What is a locust file

* Call -> 

* Allele Length ->  Trait we are tracking

* global.js -> intensity_global.js
    - g -> {
		primer_nm: primer file
		trait_min:
		trait_max:
		num_pops:  number of populations (samples?)
	   }
	- hits
	- names -> sample name dictionary for hits (index)
		


// mu data is persisted in muinfo.json in the projectDirectory so that it can be read back in when Project revisited

let mu = {
    muInfoFile: "muinfo.json",
}


What is an AlleleCall?

LocasCall -> 

called allele ->  saved Allele

each allele ->  Entity Name, length and intensity




Renaming:

AlleleCalls -> SavedSample

* muExportAlleleCalls ->  exportSavedSamples
